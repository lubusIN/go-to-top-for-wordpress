## Prerequisites

To get up and running, you will need to make sure that you have installed all of the prerequisites.

-   [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating): While you can always install Node through other means, we recommend using NVM to ensure you're aligned with the version used by our development teams. Our repository contains [an `.nvmrc` file](.nvmrc) which helps ensure you are using the correct version of Node.
-   [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/): Our repository utilizes NPM to manage project dependencies and run various scripts involved in building and testing projects.
-   [PHP 7.4+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php): WooCommerce Core currently features a minimum PHP version of 7.4. It is also needed to run Composer and various project build scripts.
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md): We use Composer to manage all of the dependencies for PHP packages and plugins.

Once you've installed all of the prerequisites, you can setup your local development.
